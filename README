Project Details
============

Repository structure
--------------------
*  `backend/`: the code for backend servers
*  `common/`: the common function (e.g., tcp, file)
*  `email/`: the code for email servers
*  `frontend/`: the code for frontend servers
*  `master/`: the code for master servers

Requirements
-------
- protobuf
- g++

How to run
-------
```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
$ python3 make.py -v <debug_log_level>
$ python3 run.py
```

For least log prints, use `python3 make.py -v 1`.
The configuration of backend servers can be modified in `common/backend.txt`.
Now there are nine backend servers (partitioned into 3 clusters).

Notes
-------
- After restarting a node, please allow some time for syncing to finish before killing the primary. 
Following are some example log messages that indicate sync finished: 
  - `[KvStore 127.0.0.1:8000]: Finished syncing with status 0. Continue accepting commands….`
  - `#KvCache-Secondary: Sent syncing finished resp to primary: SYNC DONE`

- User name and file name currently have constraints (for instance, 
no `/`, `(`, `)`, or space). Errors might occur due to unaccepted names. This was simply 
to reduce some complexity and allow easier regex matching.
